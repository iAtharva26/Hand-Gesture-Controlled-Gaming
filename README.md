## :dart: About ##

I have made a Hill Climb Racing Game Controller. The game runs as we move our hand in front of the Primary Camera. The code behind this project uses OpenCV for real-time hand tracking and CVZone for gesture recognition. With the help of Pynput, I can simulate keyboard inputs to steer the vehicle left or right depending on my hand gestures.


## :dart: How To Use ##

### Basic Interface of Window:-

### Playing the Game:-
